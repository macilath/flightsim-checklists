# Flight Sim Checklists

Created as a way to learn Go, Flight Sim Checklists will be able to manage flight sims, their aircraft, and checklists and procedures for them.

Still in heavy development, but here are the running instructions:
- Start a PostgreSQL container with the schema in place
- In `fschecklists-backend`, run the app with `go run ./main.go`
- In `fschecklists-frontend`, start the UI with `yarn start`
